        I'm Dj, a <span class="age">{_age}</span> year old full stack engineer
        and project manager currently based in Houston, Texas. When I'm not
        working on something, you can find me planning my next adventure,
        pressing keys on the piano, or with my favorite people.
        <br/><br/>
        I love making things that make people happy, either professionally with
        world class tooling to do their jobs easier, or
        <a href="https://lessgames.com">just because they're having fun</a>.
        I believe that programming is a form of art - creative expression - so
        I try to keep my job fun however I can. Right now, I work primarily with
        content creators, helping to create unique ideas with the help of my
        team.
        <br/><br/>
        Think we could make something together? Let's talk about it! I'm happy
        to help you fully flesh out an idea. Feel free to contact me through my email or Discord. My Twitter
        DMs are open as well, while I don't recommend it. If it's easier for
        you, that's an option too.
